# RaBe GitHub Actions

These are the [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
that RaBe uses for CI/CD ‚ôªÔ∏è

## Usage

See below for copy-pasteable examples of the provided actions.

If you need multiple actions to happen then it's up to you to combine them as needed. Please add an example if you use the same combo more than once.

üî• Until dependabot supports updating `jobs.call-workflow.uses`, we recommend using `@main` in all the examples below. This has been requested in [dependabot/dependabot-core@4327](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/4327). You know the drill, go üëç the issue to help us out. We'll switch back to using tagged releases once that is resolved.

### Ansible Collections

We have workflows for testing Ansible collectionis on GitHub Actions and for releasing your Ansible collections to [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com).

#### Ansible Collections: Release

Create the main `.github/workflows/release.yaml` file for an ansible collection repo:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types:
      - published

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: radiorabe/actions/.github/workflows/release-ansible-collection.yaml@main
    secrets:
      GALAXY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GALAXY_API_KEY }}
```

The collections we publish with this can be found on [our Galaxy page](https://galaxy.ansible.com/radiorabe).

#### Ansible Collections: Test

Create the main `.github/workflows/test.yaml` file for an ansible collection repo:

```yaml
name: Lint and Test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: radiorabe/actions/.github/workflows/test-ansible-collection.yaml@main
    with:
      targets: |
        roles/example
        roles/second_example
```

### Pre Commit

Create the main `.github/workflows/test.yaml` file for a project that supports [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```yaml
name: Lint and Test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: radiorabe/actions/.github/workflows/test-pre-commit.yaml@main
```

This runs pre-commit with black and isort installed. If you need more tools you can install them with `pip`:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: radiorabe/actions/.github/workflows/test-pre-commit.yaml@main
    with:
      requirements: black isort
```

### Semantic Release

For repos that want to use [go-semantic-release](https://go-semantic-release.xyz):

Create this `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: radiorabe/actions/.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml@main
    secrets:
      RABE_ITREAKTION_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RABE_ITREAKTION_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
